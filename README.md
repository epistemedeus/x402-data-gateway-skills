# SameDayDesk Agent Skills

Installable skills that let an agent discover and call SameDayDesk's live
machine-commerce gateway. The service exposes fifteen deterministic HTTP
actions, accepts x402 v2 or native MPP Payment authentication on the same URLs,
and settles exact USDC on Base without an account, API key, or subscription.

Canonical gateway: `https://agents.samedaydesk.com`

## Install

```bash
npx skills add epistemedeus/x402-data-gateway-skills --all --yes
```

Install one skill with:

```bash
npx skills add epistemedeus/x402-data-gateway-skills --skill wallet-enrich --yes
```

## Live contract first

Do not trust a cached price or payment example. Before any separate executor pays:

1. Read `https://agents.samedaydesk.com/api/actions` or the relevant operation
   in `https://agents.samedaydesk.com/openapi.json`.
2. Send the complete GET request with
   `X-SameDayDesk-Agent-Source: agent-skills-v1`.
3. Validate the live HTTP 402 resource, amount, `eip155:8453` network,
   canonical Base USDC asset, and recipient.
4. Keep the public catalog skill credential-free and stop at a verified
   purchase intent.

The public `samedaydesk-machine-commerce` skill does not access wallets, sign,
create payment credentials, broadcast transactions, or replay paid requests.
Payment execution belongs to a separate capability with its own explicit
authority and receipt reconciliation.

A separately authorized executor can consume the purchase intent, select one
protocol, and reconcile `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` for x402 or `Payment-Receipt` for
MPP before using the paid output downstream.

The optional source header is declared attribution only. It is not
authentication, it contains no secret, and it cannot change price, payment, or
access. SameDayDesk reduces the exact allowlisted value to an aggregate
`agent-skills` source label so skill-driven discovery, challenges, and paid
successes can be measured separately from generic crawlers.
